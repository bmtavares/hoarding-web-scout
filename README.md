# Hoarding Web Scout

A simple Python app that tracks changes in specific parts of specified websites.

## Motivation

Every year [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/) like many other schools open up their special admissions for Over 23, Technological Specialization Diploma and Higher Professional Technician Diploma holders.

However knowing that a date may be altered or new information added without a notice is anxiety inducing, like it was for me when I went through this path.

Having met tons of wonderful people that are willing to continue their studies choosing to embark on these admissions I thought:

> Hey, why not build a script that checks the pages for changes every once in a while and reports to me via a chat app?

And with that idea to support them, this silly app was born. That and also as a way to keep an historical record of all the page differences and files, not that I really needed to do them all since it's mostly copy pasted anyway (looking at you, random administrative person who left a ``maito:`` for the exact same department *everywhere*).

## Installation

Make sure that [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is installed and then execute the following while inside the project directory:

```bash
poetry install
```
